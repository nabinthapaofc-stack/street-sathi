# 🐶 StreetSathi — Landing Page
A simple landing page concept designed to raise awareness about street dogs and how the StreetSathi platform can help rescue and protect them.

## 🌿 About the Project
StreetSathi is a landing page prototype that explains the idea of helping injured or endangered street dogs across Nepal.  
The page includes:
- A hero section with real dog images (you will upload them)
- “Rescue Now” and “Learn More” buttons
- About Us section
- NGO/INGO collaboration info
- Mission section (Rescue, Medical Care, Community Building)
- Custom cursor effect
- Theme color: **#1c8c68** with white background

This is **not an app** — just a landing page to present the concept clearly.

# 2. Enter the project directory
